20.2.4  forward/move helpers [forward]

1 The library provides templated helper functions to simplify applying move
  semantics to an lvalue and to simplify the implementation of forwarding
  functions. All functions specified in this subclause are signal-safe
  (17.13.4).

  template <class T> constexpr T&& forward(remove_reference_t<T>& t) noexcept;
  template <class T> constexpr T&& forward(remove_reference_t<T>&& t) noexcept;

2   Mandates: For the second overload, is_lvalue_reference_v<T> is false.
3   Returns: static_cast<T&&>(t).
